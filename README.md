Ok so:

The hastag above is NOT me, is auto generated (I'm not cringe enough to hashtag anything, even my comments in python (please get the joke)).

This whole project was started because I read the 91906 NCEA requirements and flipped out (probably irrationally), so I decided to get some inspiration from codecademy to help my rapidly declining mental state. On said site, there is a task that makes a very basic game similar to pokemon.

For reference: I HAVE NEVER PLAYED POKEMON.
I know the names of some pokemon and the general vibe. That's it.
So I'm really going at this whole thing blind and having a fantastic time.

There is a lot to do, and the only "complex technique" used in this is object oriented programming (at least at this time). I might try to add some more complex features later.

Still, if by some miracle I can submit this, even after my teacher realises that the actually game is centered around taking the piss out of our school, then I hope for the best possible mark. If I can't submit this, then it makes for an excellent way to show I can competant with OOP and very comfortable with python.

If you're reading this and am NOT myself, then I strongly advise you either hire me, or get your head checked. Seriously, a 17 year old who was irrationally angry started this project on a whim and whilst I am fairly confident I'll see it to the end, no guarantee :D

Cheers, Finn J.T de Lange.
