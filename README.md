For reference: I HAVE NEVER PLAYED POKEMON.
I know the names of some pokemon and the general vibe. That's it.
So I'm really going at this whole thing blind and having a fantastic time.

There is a lot to do, and the only "complex technique" used in this is object oriented programming (at least at this time). I might try to add some more complex features later - Finn 2022

I started this project when I was 17 for a laugh and found it a fairly good learning experience, even if I never finished it. I may finish it someday - Finn 2024

Cheers, Finn J.T de Lange.
